# Hard_Sphere_Monte_Carlo_Project

The purpose of this pakage is to run simple Metropolis Monte Carlo on systems of
  hard spheres or Lennard-Jones particles.
  
Choose parameters in the Parameters.py file and simply run the code by using
  "python3 main.py".
  
For post-processesing, one can utilize the radial_dist.py, SSF.py, and 
  getAutoCorrelation.py to acquire the radial distribution function,
  static structure factor, and auto-correlation function.
